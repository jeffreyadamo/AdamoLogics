Welcome to my first project intended for it's own website!  

The goal of this project is to host my own DIY website. Coded from scratch. Building up to a full stack. I'm starting with HTML, CSS, then JavaScript. I'll build the server with Node.js, then use Express to direct to a homepage or 404 page to start. The only thing on it to start is a simple temperature calculator...and some gifs.

## First let's hook up some basic components:

- [www.adamologics.com](www.adamologics.com) was purchased through NameCheap.com
 - Repository hosted on GitHub

 - Repository to be served on Heroku
 - I'm using BootstrapCDN to start this up, but am interested in utilizing more flexbox into my own CSS. 

More details to come...
